# Theatre Events MS
***

A Theatre Events microservice (MS) based on the Command Line APP that was created previously. I chose to keep the same theme as I would like to see my Theatre Event project in two different ways

The requirements:
- A backend database
- Connect to a simple front end that enables user interaction

## The Plan

---
1. Create the Model and add @Entity to store objects to the database:
   - Store list of shows with dates, times, and price
   - Store the user inputs
2. Create a Controller
   - Make a simple endpoint for starters
3. Create Thymeleaf template to allow endpoint to display with '/h2-console'
4. Think about what should be stored in the database
   1. List of shows with time, date, and price
   2. Should it be drop-down?
   3. Should users click on a link of a show to see details?
5. Make a web page design in Canva

## The Visualisation
